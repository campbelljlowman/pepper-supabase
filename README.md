# pepper-supabase

Backend for pepper sports website. Supabase handles the database, crud endpoints for database tables, authentication, and edge functions. The majority of this repo is edge functions 
that are scheduled to update the database with sports schedules every day. This is a local setup, but can be used to mirror/update a production supabase environment.
